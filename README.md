## Developing with Apps Script üöÄ

The Apps Script Starter kit makes it easy for you to quickly setup a modern development environment and build workflow. Here's everything that's included in the starter kit to get you started:

#### Babel

Write code using ES6 features like arrow functions, destructuring, classes, template literals, and the Babel transpiler will transform your ECMAScript 2015/2017 code to ES5 that Apps Script can understand.

#### ESLint

A popular linting engine that analyzes your JavaScript code for correctness and highlights the errors in real time before you even compile the code, thus reducing the development time.

#### Webpack

Webpack is a powerful tool for bundling JavaScript modules. Developers can structure code in directory and Webpack creates a minimized and optimized bundle for pushing to production.

#### Google CLASP

A command line utility for working with Google Apps Script projects. You can develop code locally and push it to production, manage your manifest file, deploy web apps and publish new versions of apps.

#### Visual Studio Code

This incredibly powerful source code editor from Microsoft provides an integrated development environment and has built-in support for Emmet, Intellisense for code autocompletion, Command Line Terminal, Git integration, Node.js , TypeScript and more.

#### Prettier

A code formatter that will beautify your JavaScript, JSON, HTML and CSS stylesheets according to a set of rules and styles widely accepted by programmers.

#### AirBnB

Developers have their own unique style of writing code. AirBnB's JavaScript style guide outlines how JavaScript code should be written and adheres to the rules.
